# IoT-Security-Experiments

## Overview

This repository contains the source code and experimental requirements analysis for the **2022 IoT Security and Privacy Protection Experiments** course at **Huazhong University of Science and Technology**. The experiments are designed to help students understand the fundamental concepts and practical aspects of IoT security and privacy protection.

Each experiment is organized under separate directories labeled as `lab1`, `lab2`, `lab3`, etc., to facilitate easy navigation and focused learning.

## Repository Structure

- **lab1**: Contains the source code and documentation for the first experiment.
- **lab2**: Contains the source code and documentation for the second experiment.
- **lab3**: Contains the source code and documentation for the third experiment.
- ...
- **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the repository, including setup instructions and usage guidelines.

## Experiment Details

Each lab directory includes the following:

- **Source Code**: The Python (or other relevant language) scripts and programs required for the experiment.
